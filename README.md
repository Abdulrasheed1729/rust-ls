Linux ls Command Implementation in Rust
<img src="https://www.rust-lang.org/static/images/rust-logo-blk.svg" alt="rust logo">

This project aims to recreate the familiar ls command found in Linux using the Rust programming language. The goal is to provide a feature-rich and efficient alternative to the standard ls command while leveraging the power and safety of Rust.

Features
Directory listing: Display file and directory names in a specified directory.
Error handling: Provide meaningful error messages and handle exceptional cases gracefully.

Feature To Be Added
Color-coded output: Enhance readability and visual appeal by using colors to differentiate file types.
Sorting options: Sort files and directories based on various criteria such as name, size, or modification time.
Command-line flags: Support different options and flags to customize the behavior of the ls command.
Documentation: Thoroughly document the code to aid maintainability and future contributions.
Performance optimization: Optimize the implementation for efficient execution, even with large directory structures.

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/truthixify/rust-ls.git
cd ls-rust
Build the project using Cargo:

bash
Copy code
cargo build
Run the ls command:

bash
Copy code
cargo run -- [directory_path]
Replace [directory_path] with the path of the directory you want to list. If no directory is specified, the current directory will be used.

Explore the available command-line options and flags:

bash
Copy code
cargo run -- --help
